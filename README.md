### Empirical Studies on Failure Prediction for Distributed Systems Based on Tree models and Feature Selection

#### Project Introduction

In our projectï¼Œ We conduct an empirical study using six feature selection methods against four tree-based models. We present the source code and relevant results of the empirical study.

#### Related Environment

* python 3.6.13
* scikit-learn 0.24.2
* seaborn 0.11.2
* skfeatue-chappers 1.1.0
* matplotlib 3.3.4

#### Dataset

The dataset we used can be found on https://www.cnsoftbei.com/plus/view.php?aid=824. If the page expires, we will subsequently publish the experimental data with consent. The dataset contains redundant KPI metrics. We conducted PCA analysis on the dataset, and the results are as follows:
